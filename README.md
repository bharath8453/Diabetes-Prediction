# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning and Flask

This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using various medical parameters. It combines a trained machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) with a simple, interactive **Flask web application** for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 🔍 Data science analysis done in Jupyter Notebook
- 🧠 Trained ML model: `RandomForestClassifier`
- 📦 Preprocessing: Missing value imputation & feature scaling
- 🌐 Web deployment: Flask-based user interface
- 💾 Saved artifacts: `.pkl` files for model, scaler, and imputer
